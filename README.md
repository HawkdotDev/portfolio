# Portfolio
This repo is for maintaining my personal portfolio.

The current portfolio design is inspired by [Miranda](https://github.com/saarthack/Miranda) theme by [Sarthak Sharma](https://github.com/saarthack) but remade from the ground up almost entirely using React.

## Technologies used

- **React**: Utilized as the primary JavaScript library for building the user interface of the portfolio project.

- **Vite**: Employed as the build tool for the project, providing a fast development experience with rapid hot module replacement (HMR) and efficient dependency serving.
    - **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Integrated to add React support within the Vite build toolchain, enabling features like Fast Refresh for instant feedback during development using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

- **Bun**: Likely a custom or internal tool used in the project, providing additional functionality or optimizations specific to the portfolio.

- **Gsap**: Integrated for creating smooth and performant animations within the portfolio, enhancing the user experience.

- **Locomotive**: Utilized for implementing smooth scrolling effects, such as parallax scrolling or scroll snapping, to enhance the navigation experience within the portfolio.

- **Elysia**: Another tool or library used in the project, serving a specific purpose related to the functionality or design of the portfolio.
